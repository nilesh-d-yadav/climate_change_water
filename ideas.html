          <td><h2>The Life Straw filter looks like a cloth filter, but it actually features four layers of filters. The first filters dirt and silt, while the second eliminates bacteria using a halogen-based filter. Viruses and parasites are eliminated at the third level, and then an activated carbon-based filter is used to remove residues of pollutants and improve the taste and smell of the water. The instrument costs between INR180 and INR300. It can filter water up to 700 litres.

The charcoal layers adsorb coloured dyes present in the effluents.
Suspended particles adsorb in the chaff layers of corn cob pieces.
The powdered corn cob layers were also proven to absorb gasoline waste.
In 2015, Lalita Prasida received the Community Impact Award at the famous Google Science Fair in California, USA.</h2></td>

This can be done in rural settings where pond water is used on a daily basis.</h2></td>
